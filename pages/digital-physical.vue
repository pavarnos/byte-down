    <p>Your first step is to &quot;sniff around&quot; to see what they have. What might have holes in it that you can

    <p>How do you want to start?</p>
    <h2>Physical Scan</h2>
    <p>The Department of Donuts has a head office, and a factory for trying out new flavours. You could do some research
      on those to see if you can learn anything useful. Driving past their building could give us a useful
      insight. Sometimes there are articles in newspapers or trade magazines that will give us background.</p>

    <h2>Digital Scan</h2>
    <p>The Department also have a web site. Their office is probably full of computers. The factory may have industrial
      control systems or alarms or other things connected to the internet that shouldn't be. You could also research
      them
      on social media, or try some stuff via email.</p>
