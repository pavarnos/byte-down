    <h1>Digital or Physical?</h1>
    <p>Our first step is to &quot;sniff around&quot; to see what they have. What might have holes in it that we can
      use?</p>
    <p>How do you want to start?</p>
    <p><strong>Physical</strong>: The Department of Donuts has a head office, and a factory for trying out new flavours. We could do some research
      on those to see if we can learn anything useful. Sometimes there are articles in newspapers or trade magazines
      that will give us useful background</p>
    <p><strong>Digital</strong>: They also have a web site. Their office is probably full of computers. The factory may have industrial control
      systems or alarms or other things connected top the internet that shouldn't be. We could also research them on
      social media, or try some stuff via email.</p>
