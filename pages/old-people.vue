    <p>&quot;Byte Down Security and The Department of Donuts&quot; is a slightly humourous introduction to
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_hat_(computer_security)">ethical hacking</a> for teenagers.</p>
    <p>It is an interactive story. Students can choose which hacking techniques to use to reach a target, learning
      skills along the way. It has to be broad and not too deep (technical) so that there is a minimum of jargon. We
      hope this makes it more accessible to students interested in the subject but with not a lot of experience yet.
      Occasional text boxes labelled "Technical Information" contain additional technical detail for those who want to
      go deeper.</p>
    <p>Access is free. You may use this web site for teaching small and large groups of students. The content is
      <a href="https://github.com/pavarnos/byte-down">open source</a>. Your suggestions for improvements are welcome. If
      you use it and enjoy it, please let us know. It might encourage us to expand the story...
