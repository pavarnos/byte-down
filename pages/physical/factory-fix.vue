    <p>You call your electrician friend and tell them what you want to do. They say &quot;That's a bit dishonest, bro!&quot;
      and refuse to help you. Fair call.</p>
    <p>Its a bit sad though: you had the perfect device. It is a small battery powered <a
      href="https://lifehacker.com/how-to-build-a-portable-hacking-station-with-a-raspberr-1739297918"
    >Raspberry Pi</a> in a waterproof case. All you need is a spare network port somewhere. Just plug it in, flip the
      power switch and walk away. It is configured to &quot;call home&quot; once booted, and to hide its
      network traffic
      among other commonly used protocols. Once you connect to it, you can use a whole suite of tools to examine what
      else is connected to the network. The battery lasts a week. The case is black and anonymous looking. Most people
      who saw it would not touch it in case it was something important. Inside the case is a sticker with the Byte Down
      logo and a number to call, where the finder would get an honest explanation of how it got there and who to talk to
      at The Department to explain why.

    <p>You decide to drop the idea and try something else. It is a fine line between ethical hacking and the not so
      ethical stuff.</p>
