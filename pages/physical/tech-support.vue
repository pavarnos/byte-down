    <h1>Tech Support</h1>
    <p>You grab your toolkit from your desk and drive to The Department office. You park out the front and walk in
      confidently.</p>
    <p>At reception you say &quot;Hi, I'm here to fix the printer?&quot;</p>
    <p>The receptionist smiles at you and asks you to wait. She picks up the phone and makes a quick call. She listens,
      frowns, looks at you, says OK, OK a couple of times then hangs up.</p>
    <p>She says &quot;Someone came to fix the printer yesterday...&quot;</p>
    <p>Uh oh! Nearly busted! You make some excuses about being a trainee and maybe the boss is giving you a hard time
      because its your first day. You apologise and walk out the building quickly, mumbling under your breath and
      leaving the receptionist smiling behind you.</p>
    <p>Phew! Close call. You nearly got caught. Maybe try something else...</p>
