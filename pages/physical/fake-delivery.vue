    <h1>Fake Delivery</h1>
    <p>You grab a spare USB drive from your laptop case and put a RAT
      (<a href="https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-reference/remote-access-trojan">Remote Access Trojan</a>) on it,
      and
      set it up to automatically install when the drive is plugged in. Your laptop has a folder of fake family holiday
      photos that was downloaded from a stock photo web site. It is some random family that look way too happy to be at
      the beach. This will make the drive look less suspicious if someone actually does try it.</p>
    <p>You need an excuse to get you in the door of the office...</p>
    <p>Then you remember that over the weekend someone left a flyer for a circus coming to town under your windscreen
      wiper a few days back. You shuffle through the drift of rubbish on the floor of your car. Ah. There it is. You can
      promote the circus if you need a reason to be there.</p>
    <!-- todo tech info about a RAT -->
    <p>You walk in to reception. No one is behind the desk, so you put the flyer on the counter in case there is a
      camera recording the area. You had the USB drive hidden in your other hand, so you let it carefully drop next to a
      pot plant by the door on your way out without breaking your stride. You head over to the cafe for a coffee while
      you wait to see if anyone will use it.</p>
