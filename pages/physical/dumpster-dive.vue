    <p>Early next morning you turn up in some old clothes and walk quietly around the back of the factory. Nobody sees
      you. Ah. There it is. A couple of skip bins that might have something useful inside.</p>
    <p>You open the lid of the first one. It is full of dirty cartons and greasy industrial wrapping. No thanks. Not
      looking in there. You close the lid before your nose tries to run off without you.</p>
    <p>Lets try the second one. It's a bit whiffy but there is a pile of paper and cardboard inside. Hmmmm...</p>
    <p>You start to rummage through, but quickly see that the paper is just wrapping material and has nothing useful
      printed on it. You are looking for invoices, old printouts, customer lists, orders, meeting minutes, anything with
      a few clues about what happens inside the building or who the customers are suppliers are</p>
    <p>After a smelly 15 minutes you realise that The Dept must use a professional document destruction service for
      their old office paper work. This is something they are doing right.
      <MakeNote name="Paper Documents destroyed properly">Add a note</MakeNote>
      to your report to congratulate them.
    </p>
    <p>Go home, have a quick shower, and you should be back in the office in time to start the day as normal.</p>
