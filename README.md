# Byte Down Security

This is a "Pick a Path" story to teach the core concepts of white hat hacking to year 5-9 high school students (age
10-14).

We created a fake company called Byte Down Security. It is the student's first day on the job. They are asked to do a
penetration test on The Department of Donuts, a fake government department that is full of holes. Choose what to do by
clicking buttons to navigate the story. There is a kit of generic hacking tools that is visible when needed. These
represent broad classes of tooling rather than any specific item.

The concepts may seem simplistic to a security expert: we had to keep it simple and generic and skip a *lot* of detail
to make it understandable by this age group. Selected sections may have an optional "Technical Detail" panel they can
open to view the names and links to real tools that might be used for each task, or info about the type of vulnerability
discovered.

There are multiple ways to win, many holes to find. Encourage students to keep exploring once they found something.
There are also ways to fail. You may get caught by the IT department who are not totally clueless. If you get caught,
learn something, start again and keep exploring until you find all the holes.

Pull requests and other contributions welcome. There is always new things to learn.
